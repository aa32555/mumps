Cloning the repository for the latest updates
You may want to clone the AAMUMPS repository for access to the latest code.

git clone https://gitlab.com/AAMUMPS/DB/YDB.git
To contribute or help with further development, fork the repository, clone your fork to a local copy and begin contributing! Please also set up the pre-commit script to automatically enforce some coding conventions. Assuming you are in the top-level directory, the following will work:

ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks
Install pre-built AAMUMPS binaries
To quickly get started with running AAMUMPS, follow the instructions on our Get Started page.

Build and Install AAMUMPS from source
AAMUMPS relies on CMake to generate the Makefiles to build binaries from source. Refer to the Release Notes for each release for a list of the Supported platforms in which we build and test AAMUMPS binary distributions. At least cmake version 3 is required.

# Ubuntu or Debian-like distro
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends cmake
# CentOS
sudo yum install cmake3
On CentOS it will be installed as cmake3 instead of cmake, so use cmake3 on CentOS wherever cmake is referenced below.

Note: Both gcc and Clang/LLVM are supported on x86_64. To use Clang/LLVM you would need to install the Clang/LLVM packages for your distribution in addition to the packages listed below. For example for Ubuntu Linux:

 sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends clang llvm lld
Install prerequisite packages

Ubuntu Linux OR Raspbian Linux OR Beagleboard Debian
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends file cmake make gcc git curl tcsh {libconfig,libelf,libicu,libncurses,libreadline}-dev binutils ca-certificates

Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S file cmake make gcc git curl tcsh {libconfig,libelf,icu,ncurses,readline} binutils ca-certificates

CentOS Linux OR RedHat Linux
sudo yum install file cmake make gcc git curl tcsh {libconfig,libicu,ncurses,elfutils-libelf,readline}-devel binutils ca-certificates

SUSE (SLES or SLED) or OpenSUSE Leap or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
sudo zypper install cmake make gcc git file curl tcsh binutils-gold icu {libconfig,libicu,ncurses,libelf,readline}-devel binutils ca-certificates
There may be other library dependencies or the packages may have different names.

Fetch the latest released version of AAMUMPS source

To obtain the source code corresponding to the latest AAMUMPS release and build binaries from that source please use the following set of shell commands which fetches the latest tagged release by performing a git clone. After cloning AAMUMPS source files can be seen in the directory named YDB.

ydb_distrib="https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/7957109/repository/tags"
ydb_tmpdir='tmpdir'
mkdir $ydb_tmpdir
wget -P $ydb_tmpdir ${ydb_distrib} 2>&1 1>${ydb_tmpdir}/wget_latest.log
ydb_version=`sed 's/,/\n/g' ${ydb_tmpdir}/tags | grep -E "tag_name|.pro.tgz" | grep -B 1 ".pro.tgz" | grep "tag_name" | sort -r | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f6`
git clone --depth 1 --branch $ydb_version https://gitlab.com/AAMUMPS/DB/YDB.git
cd YDB
You should find this README, LICENSE, COPYING and CMakeLists.txt file and sr_* directories.

Build the AAMUMPS binaries:

mkdir build
cd build
Note: By default the script creates production (pro) builds of AAMUMPS. To create a debug (dbg) build of AAMUMPS supply the -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug parameter to cmake (Note: title case is important)

Build with gcc
cmake ..
export ydb_icu_version=65.1.suse # this is needed only on OpenSUSE Leap 15.4 or SLES 15.4 or SLED 15.4
make -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
make install	# For known errors in this step and how to work around them, consult the FAQ section below
cd AAMUMPS_r*  # The latest release number will be seen in the directory name
Build with Clang/LLVM
export CC=/usr/bin/clang
cmake -D CMAKE_LINKER:PATH=/usr/bin/ld.lld ..
export ydb_icu_version=65.1.suse # this is needed only on OpenSUSE Leap 15.4 or SLES 15.4 or SLED 15.4
make -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
make install	# For known errors in this step and how to work around them, consult the FAQ section below
cd AAMUMPS_r*  # The latest release number will be seen in the directory name
Note that the make install command above does not create the final installed AAMUMPS. Instead, it stages AAMUMPS for distribution. If cmake or make issues an error in the above steps, please see the FAQ below.

Installing AAMUMPS

Now you are ready to install AAMUMPS. The default installation path for each release includes the release (e.g. for AAMUMPS r2.00, the default installation path is /usr/local/lib/AAMUMPS/r200), but can be controlled using the --installdir option. Run ./ydbinstall --help for a list of options.

Note that if the ydb_icu_version env var is set to a value other than what pkg-config --modversion icu-io would return (observed on a SLED 15 or openSUSE Leap system), then the env var value needs to be preserved across the sudo call hence the use of preserve-env below. It is not needed on other systems but does not hurt either.

sudo --preserve-env=ydb_icu_version ./ydbinstall
cd - ; make clean
Docker
Pre-requisites
A working Docker installation on the platform of choice.

NOTE: You must have at least docker 17.05 as multi-stage builds are used within the docker file

Image information
The docker image is built using the generic ydb_env_set script that gives the user some sane defaults to begin exploring AAMUMPS. This isn't meant for production usage.

The commands below assume that you want to remove the docker container after running the command, which means that if you don't mount a volume that contains your database and routines they will be lost. If you want the container to persist remove the --rm parameter from the docker command.

Volumes are also supported by mounting to the /data directory. If you want to mount the local directory ydb-data into the container to save your database and routines locally and use them in the container in the future, add the following command line parameter before the AAMUMPS/AAMUMPS argument:

-v $PWD/ydb-data:/data
This creates a ydb-data directory in your current working directory. This can be deleted after the container is shutdown/removed if you want to remove all data created in the AAMUMPS container (such as your database and routines).

The AAMUMPS GUI is available on port 9080; statistics for the GUI is running on port 9081.

Pre-built images
Pre-built images are available on docker hub

Running a Pre-built image
docker run --rm -it -p 9080-9081:9080-9081 download.AAMUMPS.com/AAMUMPS/AAMUMPS # you can add a specific version after a ":" if desired
Build Steps
Build the image
docker build -t AAMUMPS/AAMUMPS:latest-master .
Run the created image
docker run --rm -it -p 9080-9081:9080-9081 AAMUMPS/AAMUMPS:latest-master
FAQ
The CMake build fails with the following message followed by one or more cases.

CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND. Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files
This indicates that required libraries are not found. Please consult the list of libraries and check your distributions package manager.

AAMUMPS installation fails with %YDB-E-DLLNOOPEN

Example error message that would be printed to the screen:

%YDB-E-DLLNOOPEN, Failed to load external dynamic library /usr/local/lib/AAMUMPS/r136/libAAMUMPS.so
%YDB-E-TEXT, libtinfo.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
This indicates that the libtinfo5 package isn't installed and libtinfo6 is not backwards compatible with libtinfo5. This has been observed on Ubutntu 18.10 and could possibly apply to other Linux distributions as well. To resolve the issue, libtinfo5 can be installed via the following command:

sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libtinfo5
AAMUMPS compilation fails with plugin needed to handle lto object

There is a known issue with binutils and has been observed on Ubuntu 18.10 and could possibly apply to other Linux distributions including debian unstable that may cause ar and ranlib to generate the following error messages:

/usr/bin/ar: CMakeFiles/libmumps.dir/sr_port/zshow_locks.c.o: plugin needed to handle lto object
/usr/bin/ar: CMakeFiles/libmumps.dir/sr_port/zshow_output.c.o: plugin needed to handle lto object

/usr/bin/ranlib: libmumps.a(find_line_addr.c.o): plugin needed to handle lto object
/usr/bin/ranlib: libmumps.a(find_line_start.c.o): plugin needed to handle lto object
/usr/bin/ranlib: libmumps.a(find_mvstent.c.o): plugin needed to handle lto object
The work around is to bump the open file descriptors limit to 4096 or higher

bash/sh

ulimit -n 4096
OR

tcsh

limit openfiles 4096
